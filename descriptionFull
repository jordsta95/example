This is the section where you will put all information you need about your mod.<br>
This information may include:
<ul>
<li>Mod items</li>
<li>Recipes</li>
<li>Backstory</li>
<ul>
<li>why you made the mod</li>
</ul>
<li>Anything else</li>
</ul>
Everything is written in pure html, so don't be afraid to do things such as
<div style="padding-left:10%;">Add padding</div>
Or anything else, such as
<div style="background:#CCC;color:#000;">
Change text colours, or add a different background.
</div>
